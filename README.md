## Backend Boilerplate for ASP.NET CORE DEVELOPER

## Description

- This boilerplate made for developer pressure relief purpose in their daily work.
- In my 5 year's experience, I saw that, there has some common repeated work for backend developer. Common work means, regular CRUD where has no logic, no mathmatics or any other complex implementation. Just pick the data from frontend and bind in the model, then save the data, get the data, update the data, delete the data. So, I made a dynamic solution where developer can save their time and enjoy their life and doing many more things that can help in developer community and help the world. What I solved right now is, this dynamic solution will work for 2 Layer. That means, at a time, using one request they can insert/update/delete in 2 table. But Retrive data from 2 or multiple table.
